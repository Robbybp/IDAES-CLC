Gas-Solids Contactor Models
===========================

This section contains a summary of IDAES models for gas-solids contacting operations.

Due to the added complexity of heterogeneous reactions involving gas and solids phases, the requirements for property packages in these models are generally more complex than for reactors involving only fluid phases. Users should take care to read the requirements and expectations of each model regarding properties to ensure the packages they use are properly supported.
