This is mainly for Keith B. to fill in.
But pointers to dependencies like CPLEX and Gurobi should be added.

Dependencies
------------

Some of the model code depends on external solvers.

CPLEX
^^^^^
Wikipedia summarizes `CPLEX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPLEX>`_ thusly:

    The IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer solves integer programming problems, very
    large linear programming problems using either primal or dual variants
    of the simplex method or the barrier interior point method, convex and
    non-convex quadratic programming problems, and convex quadratically
    constrained problems (solved via second-order cone programming, or SOCP).

* `Setting up CPLEX Python <http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.5.1/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/GettingStarted/topics/set_up/Python_setup.html>`_

Gurobi
^^^^^^

* `Gurobi license <https://user.gurobi.com/download/licenses/free-academic>`_
* `Gurobi solver <http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer>`_
* `Gurobi Python setup <http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/quickstart_mac/the_gurobi_python_interfac.html>`_
